# Flashcard Creator for Obsidian

A time-efficient desktop application for creating Anki-style flashcards that are compatible with the [Space Repetition](https://github.com/st3v3nmw/obsidian-spaced-repetition) plugin in Obsidian.

## üéØ Purpose

This application streamlines the process of creating flashcards for use with Obsidian's Space Repetition plugin. Instead of manually formatting each flashcard in markdown, you can quickly create multiple cards using this GUI application and export them as a properly formatted markdown file.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intuitive GUI**: Clean, dark-themed interface built with CustomTkinter
- **Flexible Card Order**: Choose between "Question First" or "Answer First" formats
- **Text & Image Support**: Add text, images, or both as questions and/or answers
- **Image Preview**: See a thumbnail preview of selected images before adding the card
- **Batch Creation**: Add multiple cards quickly without switching between files
- **Obsidian Compatible**: Exports in the exact format required by the Space Repetition plugin, with images referenced in markdown and copied to an `images/` folder
- **Modern, Non-Resizable UI**: Window is centered, non-resizable, and visually consistent
